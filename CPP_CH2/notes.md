- Every C++ program must have a function MAIN to tell it where to start executing. Contains 4 parts:
    1) A return type
    2) A name
    3) A parameter list enclosed in parentheses
    4) A function body enclosed in a set of "curly braces"

- C++ is a compiled language, must be translated from human-readable form to something a machine can "understand.

- This translation is done by a compiler.

- C++ Source Code ----> C++ compiler ------> Object Code

- When a larger program requires multiple parts to be integrated, they are linked together to form and executable program using another program called... A Linker (Shocker).

- A library is simply some code usually ritten by others that we access using declarations found in an #included file.

- A declaration  is a program statement how a piece of code can be used.

- Errors found by the compile-time errors.

- Errors found by the linker are called link-time errors

- Errors not found until the program is run are called run-time errors OR logic errors.
